Gaz International Sells Its Siberian Oil Operations to Local Company

ZURICH - Yevgeni Star, a mid-sized Russian oil company, has bought the Siberian oil and gas operations of Zurich-based Gaz International. While no official figures have been released by either firm, the deal is believed to worth in the vicinity of $145 million.

Until recently, Gaz International had been seeking to expand its exploration and refining operations, but it has reportedly been frustrated by local regulatory bodies. Gaz International shares rose by 1% as news of the sale filtered into the media.

Yevgeni Star, which has some cross-share holdings with large industrial corporations in related and unrelated fields, notably in the energy and shipbuilding sectors, will become one of Russian's leading players in the vital strategic area of energy supplies.

Explaining the reasons for the sale, Gaz International CEO Fritz Faschier told reporters yesterday, "Our board of directors believes that this is the ideal time to consolidate our operations by concentrating on less-risky investments while at the same time boosting our interests in research and development. I mean, in particular, research into alternative fuels and energy sources. I have no doubt that this deal is in the interests of both parties."

It is known that the deal includes significant technology transfers. A team of Gaz International engineers and administrators will train Yevgeni engineers in the operation of exploration and extraction technology developed by the international giant.

Yevgeni Star operators were also keen to acquire Gaz International's license to explore and develop northern oil fields until 2015. The current production of 10,000 barrels a day is expected to at least double over the next 5 years.

Due to the complex nature of legal arrangements surrounding the transfer of licenses and technological information, the deal is not expected to be sewn up before January of next year. Approval for the license transfer must be negotiated with Russian authorities while several major Swiss banks will vet the financial arrangements and the details of technology transfer

171. What is true about Gaz International?

(A) It is a Russian-owned company.

(B) It took control of another company.

(C) Its stock price has slipped due to a false rumor.

**(D) It was involved in a multi-million dollar transaction recently.**

172. Which of the following will be the result of a deal mentioned in the article?

(A) Gaz International will become the leading company in its field.

(B) Yevgeni Star seems to have gotten the better end of the deal.

**(C) Gaz International will now focus on establishing its business in new areas.**

(D) Yevgeni Star will distribute shares to its top management staff.

173. Who is Mr. Fritz Faschier?

(A) A reporter for a local newspaper

**(B) The president of Gaz International**

(C) A spokesperson for Yevgeni Star

(D) A Russian authority

174. According to the article, when will the deal be finalized?

(A) In 2015

(B) In five years

(C) Within the following weeks

**(D) By early next year**

175. What is the main cause of the delay in closing the deal?

(A) Both companies want to take it slow.

(B) Some complications have surfaced regarding legal issues.

(C) The Russian authorities usually take a long time to process a new license.

**(D) There are many details to be worked out**

Re: faulty print cartridges

Dear Madam or Sir

On a recent visit to your store, I purchased a box of Onyx Print Cartridges for our 3 printers. As you are well aware, fast and high-quality pritting is essential in any business, big or small, these days. You can imagine our disappointment when, after installation, we found that the cartridges were faulty, either in the feed mechanism or in the ink itself. When we examined the packages, we discovered that all three cartridges had passed their use-by date.

However, when I returned them to your store, I was refused free replacement cartridges as the receipt

had unfortunately somehow been misplaced. This was extremely disappointing to me, as I am a long- term customer of your store. Am I not to be trusted? The cartridges were clearly expired. I have since bought cartridges elsewhere, and I have no intention of returning to your store. But I wanted to express my dissatisfaction to you, and I hope that you will examine your policy on returns.

Thank you.

177. Why was Ms. Nixon's request turned down by the store?

178. Why were the cartridges returned to the store?

New World Supermarkets 5th Floor Federation Tower Melbourne September 8, 2006

Dear Sir or Madam,

I received the bill for my August account on September 5, 2006, and was very surprised to find that I had been charged for a box of diapers I didn't buy. I am an old-age pensioner, and my children are all grown up. It's very unlikely that I will be needing diapers any time soon.

I have to say that I am surprised. I have shopped at New World Supermarkets for 30 years, and I've generally been very satisfied with your standards of service.

Could you please check your accounts and sort out the problem? I have a fixed income, so a bill for $50 for something I never bought is making me very worried. Please let me know as soon as possible.

Yours faithfully,

Ms. Suzanne Jones
