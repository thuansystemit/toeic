Mr. Joe Fernandez 1385 Midland Ave. Detroit, Michigan

Dear Mr. Fernandez,

As the president, I am proud to announce that this Friday marks the 30th anniversary of our long and successful running country club. This, of course, calls for a night of celebration. And for this reason, we have reserved the Grand Hall at the Falcon Hotel this Friday at 7 p.m. for a night of fine dining and dancing.

On this special evening, the neest members of our club will get an opportunity to listen to the thoughts of our older members and exchange ideas in an informal atmosphere. The newest members, who will be carrying on our tradition, should hear what the older members have to say.

Further, the food will be superb. I've had a chance to dine at the hotel several times in the past in other functions, and it was the food that convinced me to hold our event there. I am quite certain that all of our members will share my feeling. Anyhow, I am looking forward to this Friday when all of our members can let loose and have some fun.

Therefore, this is a letter officially to invite you and your spouse or significant other to join us on this memorable evening.

Please let us know if you can't attend.

Yours sincerely,

Jeff Connelly
