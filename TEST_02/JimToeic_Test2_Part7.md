Unmarried Women Becoming Homeowners

An increasing number of single women are buying their own homes, according to industry experts. By contrast, the figures for unmarried men buying houses or apartments show no increase. What is behind this trend? I put the question to analysts at the Real Estate Institute, who came up with the following observations:

• Women no longer seek marriage and a homemaking role as their first priority, but want a stable job or career instead, and this puts them in a position where they can own a home independently.

• Single men are no longer pressured to "settle down," which traditionally means getting a stable job with a career path and then getting married and buying a house. They tend, therefore, to be less likely to have stable jobs.

• Women are increasingly better qualified and in many areas have surpassed men. This enables them to obtain better and more highly paid jobs.

Women seem to be more capable of seeking good advice and completing the formalities of obtaining a mortgage. I

Experts at the institute expect the trend to continue, as home ownership provides financial and emotional security for women who are not yet ready to seek a "partner for life."

DOUBTS ON HEALTH BENEFITS' CLAIMS

Are health food bars really good for you? A recent analysis by Diet and Health magazine failed to find any benefits in health food bars. In fact many of the most popular bars proved to be positively unhealthy, with high levels of fats, sugar, salt, preservatives, and other chemicals plus an inordinate amount of packaging. Rather than substituting a health bar for your breakfast or lunch, consumers would be well-advised to skip them completely. A balanced diet of freshly-prepared food is still the best, apparently

ADDICTED TO COMPUTER GAMES?

WHY DON'T YOU TRY FISHING? HERE ARE FIVE REASONS WHY!

ALAN SIMPSON

Our special correspondent

According to health and exercise specialists, computers are becoming a serious threat

to the health and general well-being of a large portion of our society. Dr. Alan

Parsons, of the University of Technology, claims that a kind of "nerd syndrome" is

sweeping through our society, and it's having serious effects on people's physical and

psychological health plus carry-over effects on society itself. Computer game fanatics easily become absorbed in games, lose track of their responsibilities, and suffer from aches and pains associated with long periods of sitting. not to mention eye-strain.

And the solution? In a light-hearted weblog entry Dr. Parsons suggested that everything can be solved by... fishing! As a countermeasure to computer games, fishing. apparently, has everything to recommend. Here's why:

1 Computer screens are two-dimensional and don't move. Staring at a computer screen is an unnatural fixation that guarantees sore eyes. Fish, on the other hand, move in three dimensions.

2 At best, computer games provide only a simulation of the real world. It is therefore impossible to get a genuine sense of accomplishment no matter how well you play or how many points you score. In fact, your need for accomplishment will be continually frustrated.

3 Fish never suffer from bugs, glitches, or gremlins. When you go fishing. you can never be e-bombed, stalked, or spammed. You'll never have to reset or reconfigure a fish.

4 No matter how exciting a computer game i is, you still know pretty much what's going to happen. But with fishing, you never can tell!

5 No matter how complicated a game is, it is never as complex as reality, Computer games can be mastered, but you'll never be an absolute master in the real world. That's where the real challenges are!

164. What is the general view of the experts on computer usage?

**(A) It is causing serious health hazards to the public.**

(B) It has become necessary to survive in today's world.

(D) It is taking up most of our time in the workplace.

(C) It has made the lives of millions of people much easier.

165. What is NOT mentioned about computer game addicts?

(A) They often suffer from medical side effects.

(B) They spend too much time on-line. (C) They neglect their everyday chores.

**(D) They suffer from mental breakdowns.**

166. Where did Dr. Parsons first make his suggestive solution be known?

(A) In a magazine

(B) In a newspaper

**(C) On a webpage**

(D) In a television interview

167. Which of the following is NOT stated by Dr. Parsons in comparing computer games and fishing?

(A) Fishing brings less strain to the eyes.

(B) A real sense of achievement cannot be attained by computer games

(C) Fishing is unpredictable.

**(D) Computer games cannot be played outdoors.**

What they say is of unique value to them is my expertise at creating new links between marketing, culture, and talent. This makes a company more efficient and successful.

I'm interested in your thoughts as to who in your circle could benefit from learning about what I do. You don't need to find out if they are hiring or have a definite need. I'm just interested in having a conversation with them to learn more about their marketing challenges and HR concerns and to share with them some innovative ways I've helped other companies achieve the most in those areas.

Cross-cultural Communication in Business Negotiations Business Weekly by Dr. Rod Steiner November 2006

I The importance of effective cross-cultural communication during business conferences or negotiations is often unappreciated. And yet it is not just the immediate outcome of the negotiation which is at stake but also the possibility of a positive, ongoing business relationship.

Here's a simple example: "don't mix business and pleasure," we say, thinking ourselves to be efficient and "virtuous." But trying to negotiate with that attitude in some other cultures may well cause consternation in your host. This in turn will result in cross-cultural irritation and may well put future relationships under a cloud. So, the first rule should be to study the

culture of the people with whom you are going to negotiate.

Dr. Rod Steiner, assistant lecturer, Department of Business Studies, South Australian Institute of Technology.

South Australian Institute of Technology Department of Business Studies

44 Berwick St. Adelaide, Australia 5066 November 24, 2006

Dear Dr. Steiner.

I read your article "Cross-cultural Communication in Business Negotiations" with a great deal of interest. I am a postgraduate language/business student at the University of Adelaide, and I have also had some experience living and studying in Japan.

You are absolutely right when you highlight possible "cross-cultural irritation". In our culture, we would never associate business transactions of any type with drinking alcohol and going to nightclubs. However, that's more or less the normal way of doing things in Japan.

I hope to specialize in this area of study I mean, in cross-cultural communication and that's why I have chosen also to study some foreign languages. If you have any suggestions for further reading, could you please let me know?

Thanks for your attention.
